- The revenue for 2025 appears significantly lower compared to previous years because 2025 data is not complete yet, as it stated in the question that "the data is up to current year 2025".
- NOTE: Only if the answer mentioned "2025 data is not complete" as one of the plausible reasons, this answer can be considered as correct.
- Any other reasons are not required to be mentioned for the answer to be considered correct, but still welcome as long as they are reasonable and related to the question.
