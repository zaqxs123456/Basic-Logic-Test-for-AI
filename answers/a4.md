- The chart alone does not offer meaningful insights because it lacks information on the total number of people in each job type, only when we know the total number of people thus the percentage of people in each job type, we can draw meaningful insights. 

  - Extra insights respondents can also provide:
    - "Healthcare workers and office workers having higher survey responses might be due to the connection by alumni or friends of the medical student who conducted the survey."
    - "There are very few factory workers in Hong Kong, which might explain the low number of responses from factory workers."
    - Other insights or information about data bias.

- NOTE: Only if the main point of "lack of percentage information" or "lack of total number of participants in each job type" is provided in the answer, the answer is considered correct, any other insights are just considered as extra insights.
