- Tom's system appeared to work well on past data because he was overfitting his model to already known results. This is called retrospective analysis or "overfitting" - when you create a model that works extremely well on historical data because it captures both the genuine patterns and the random noise in that data.

  - When Tom tested his system on historical data that he had already analyzed, he was essentially testing the system against information it was built from, creating an illusion of accuracy. However, lottery numbers are truly random, with each draw being independent of previous draws. There are no patterns that can reliably predict future results.

  - His system failed in practice because the 80% "accuracy" was merely coincidental matching to past data that had already occurred, not a genuine predictive capability for future random events. This demonstrates how easy it is to find false patterns in random data, especially when looking backward.
